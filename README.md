Hi there!

I have a partner and a dog and a cat...or the cat has me and my partner and the dog.

I am a Southpaw who owns a pair of left-handed scissors.

My friends call me just *Bhoot* because Bhoot means Ghost.

Find me on: [Website](https://bhoot.dev) • [Mastodon](https://functional.cafe/@bhoot) • [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/~bhoot) • [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jbhoot)
