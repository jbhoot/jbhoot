Hi there!

I have a partner and a dog and a cat...or the cat has me and my partner and the dog.

I am a Southpaw who owns a pair of left-handed scissors.

My friends call me just *Bhoot* because Bhoot means Ghost.

Find me on: [Website](https://bhoot.dev) ‚Ä¢ [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/~bhoot) ‚Ä¢ [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bhoot.dev) ‚Ä¢ [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jbhoot)
